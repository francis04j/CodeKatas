how come the player that rolls the ball is not considered in the Roll method?

The player is not explicitly considered in the Roll method because the original problem description does not specify the need to track multiple players or associate rolls with individual players. The implementation assumes the game is for a single player, which simplifies the design. However, if the game were to support multiple players, the following considerations and modifications would need to be made:

Why the Player is Not Currently Considered
Single-Player Focus:

The problem description implicitly focuses on calculating the score for one player. In this context, there’s no requirement to differentiate between rolls of multiple players.
The Game class is designed to handle a single player's game session.
Simplicity:

Adding player management to the Roll method would introduce additional complexity, such as maintaining a list of players, tracking the current player, and storing rolls for each player.
What Would Change for Multiplayer Support?
If we wanted to extend the implementation to handle multiple players, we would need to:

Associate Rolls with Players:

Maintain a data structure to store rolls for each player, such as a dictionary:
csharp
Copy
Edit
private Dictionary<string, List<int>> playerRolls = new Dictionary<string, List<int>>();
Modify the Roll Method:

Include a player identifier as a parameter:
csharp
Copy
Edit
public void Roll(string player, int pins)
{
    if (!playerRolls.ContainsKey(player))
    {
        playerRolls[player] = new List<int>();
    }
    playerRolls[player].Add(pins);
}
Track Player Turns:

Implement logic to track which player is currently rolling and ensure the correct order of turns.
Calculate Scores per Player:

Adjust the Score method to calculate the total for a specific player:
csharp
Copy
Edit
public int Score(string player)
{
    if (!playerRolls.ContainsKey(player))
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("Player not found.");
    }
    
    var rolls = playerRolls[player];
    int totalScore = 0;
    int rollIndex = 0;

    for (int frame = 0; frame < 10; frame++)
    {
        if (IsStrike(rollIndex, rolls))
        {
            totalScore += 10 + StrikeBonus(rollIndex, rolls);
            rollIndex++;
        }
        else if (IsSpare(rollIndex, rolls))
        {
            totalScore += 10 + SpareBonus(rollIndex, rolls);
            rollIndex += 2;
        }
        else
        {
            totalScore += FrameScore(rollIndex, rolls);
            rollIndex += 2;
        }
    }

    return totalScore;
}
Revised Design for Multiplayer
Attributes:
Dictionary<string, List<int>> playerRolls: Maps player names to their rolls.
string currentPlayer: Tracks whose turn it is.
Methods:
Roll(string player, int pins): Adds rolls for a specific player.
Score(string player): Calculates the score for a specific player.
NextPlayer(): Advances the turn to the next player.
Why Keep it Simple for Single Player?
In a single-player context, there’s no need for these additional layers of complexity:

Managing player turns and scores is unnecessary.
It’s better to maintain simplicity and focus on accurately scoring the game for one player.
However, the framework can easily be extended for multiplayer support by incorporating the changes outlined above.
